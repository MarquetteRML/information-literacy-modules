<p>These modules were developed to assist librarians teaching information literacy instruction in Marquette's First Year English (FYE) program. They have been used in a traditional face to face instruction, flipped classroom instruction or as stand alone online assignments.
</p>

<p>
The modules were designed using Articulate Storyline 3 - Build 3.13.26122.0 and were exported as SCORM packages which were then loaded into FYE course sites in Desire2Learn (D2L), Marquette's Learning Management System (LMS). 
</p>

<p>
A more in depth description of how the modules were used in information literacy instruction can be <a href="https://works.bepress.com/eric_kowalik/16/">found in the chapter "Problems and Promises of Using LMS Learner Analytics for Assessment"</a> in the 2018 book <em>Academic Libraries and the Academy: Strategies and Approaches to Demonstrate Your Value, Impact, and Return on Investment, Volume Two</em>.
</p>

<p>
In 2020 the project team worked with Marquette's BI team to develop an interactive dashboard capturing usage of these modules across the Marquette LMS. <a href="https://works.bepress.com/eric_kowalik/28/">This five-minute flare from D2L's Fusion conference explains how this dashboard was created and how it is being leveraged to measure and expand the libraryís instructional impact across campus</a>. 
</p>

<p>
In 2015, Grand Valley State University (GVSU) adapted the anatomy of citation tutorial to meet the instructional needs at their campus. <a href="https://works.bepress.com/eric_kowalik/13/">In a co-authored paper</a>, members of the GVSU and Marquette team share the peaks and pitfalls of developing the module.

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Accessibility Statement and Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)
</h3>

<p>
The project team wants to empower all learners to have accessible, compelling, and enjoyable e-learning experiences. With that goal in mind, these modules were built to support Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and Section 508 accessibility standards, <a href="docs/20211101-Interactive-Information-Literacy-Modules-VPAT.docx">as described in this VPAT</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The VPAT is a living document. It is updated as enhancements are developed and new issues come to light. <a href="mailto:eric.kowalik@marquette.edu">If you discover an accessibility issue, please let us know</a>. We're on this journey together!

<p><img style="float: left; padding: 5px;" src="images/Narrowing-a-Topic.png" alt="screen shot of narrowing a topic" width="250">In this scenario based activity, students are asked to help 3 of their classmates narrow down their topics. By moving a series of sliders, students aim to develop a research question that is interesting, yet narrow enough to find scholarly sources.

Venn Diagrams change color and the search statement is dynamically updated as students select the Boolean commands. Constructive feedback is given for each submission and students have an opportunity to construct their own search statement at the end of the tutorial.

<p><img style="float: left; padding: 5px;" src="images/Evaluating-Sources.png" alt="screen shot of evaluating sources learning object" width="250">In this scenario based activity, students are asked to help 4 of their classmates evaluate 3 sources they are considering using for their paper. Students can read the entirety of each source, then write a 2 to 3 sentence explanation of why their classmate should or shouldn’t use the source and why. Based on the concept of Calibrated Peer Review, there is one exemplar source, one substandard source and one bubble source.

Students must identify the needed parts of 3 real publications and drag them to the appropriate category, i.e. Journal Title, Volume, Page Number. Upon completion of the activity, students are show the MLA citation for each publication.
