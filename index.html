<p>These modules were developed to assist librarians teaching information literacy instruction in Marquette's First Year English (FYE) program. They have been used in a traditional face to face instruction, flipped classroom instruction or as stand alone online assignments.
</p>

<p>
The modules were designed using the first version of Articulate Storyline and were exported as SCORM packages which were then loaded into FYE course sites in Desire2Learn (D2L), Marquette's Learning Management System (LMS). 
</p>

<p>
A more in depth description of how the modules were used in information literacy instruction can be <a href="http://crln.acrl.org/content/76/1/10.full" target="_blank">found in the article "Is flipping enough?"</a> in the January 2015 issue of <em>College & Research Libraries News</em>.

<p><img style="float: left; padding: 5px;" src="images/Narrowing-a-Topic.png" alt="screen shot of narrowing a topic" width="250">In this scenario based activity, students are asked to help 3 of their classmates narrow down their topics. By moving a series of sliders, students aim to develop a research question that is interesting, yet narrow enough to find scholarly sources.

<p><img style="float: left; padding: 5px;" src="images/Boolean-Bonanza.png" alt="screen shot of boolean bonanza module" width="250">Students are asked to help 3 of their classmates choose the best Boolean search commands for their searches. Venn Diagrams change color and the search statement is dynamically updated as students select the Boolean commands. Constructive feedback is given for each submission and students have an opportunity to construct their own search statement at the end of the tutorial.

<p><img style="float: left; padding: 5px;" src="images/Evaluating-Sources.png" alt="screen shot of evaluating sources learning object" width="250">In this scenario based activity, students are asked to help 4 of their classmates evaluate 3 sources they are considering using for their paper. Students can read the entirety of each source, then write a 2 to 3 sentence explanation of why their classmate should or shouldn’t use the source and why. Based on the concept of Calibrated Peer Review, there is one exemplar source, one substandard source and one bubble source.

Show students the value of learning about citations by having them practice on real content! Students must identify the needed parts of 3 real publications and drag them to the appropriate category, i.e. Journal Title, Volume, Page Number. Upon completion of the activity, students are show the MLA citation for each publication.
