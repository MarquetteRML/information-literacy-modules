Articulate Storyline Information Literacy Modules
=============================

Interactive Articulate Storyline modules developed to teach undergraduates information literacy skills such as narrowing a topic, evaluating sources and citing. [Visit the GitHub page for this project to see working examples of these modules.](http://marquetterml.github.io/information-literacy-modules)

Customization
=============

To customize or edit the modules you will need to have [Articulate Storyline](https://www.articulate.com/products/storyline-why.php). The latest source files were developed using Storyline 2 Update 10. You WILL need Storyline 2 to edit these files.

Storyline 1 source files are available in the repository archive. 

The modules were developed to be used as SCORM packages in a Learning Management System (LMS). If you intend to use these modules outside of an LMS, on a website for example, you can remove a number of slides from the modules.

Installation
============

Open the Storyline file, then follow the instructions below that relate to where you will be deploying these modules, i.e. an LMS or a website.
